# Algebraic-Calculator

In the process of building a basic calculator web app. 
The eventual goal is to be able to solve simple arithmetic as well as systems of linear equations.

Input an expression with any alphabetic characters (lowercase for now) to simplify.
Ex. 8x * 2 + 9 * (y + y)  => 16x + 2y + 9
Input two expressions separated by an equal sign to solve for the value of a single variable
Ex. 5u - 7 = 2u + 11 => u = 6
Input multiple linear equations, each separated by a comma to solve for the value of each variable
Ex. x + y + z = 6, 3x - y - 2z = -3, -2x - 5y + 2z = 11 => x=2, y=-1, z=5
