# Algebraic-Calculator

In the process of building a basic calculator web app. 
The eventual goal is to be able to solve simple arithmetic as well as systems of linear equations.

Current version allows solving of multi-variable linear systems, albeit with a few assumptions.


#TODO

* Handle invalid input
* Make output readable
* Sort linear systems 
* Build a shiny HTML page to interface with the user
* Re-read comments
